Project Title: How Precipitation Impacts Wildfires in California
Team Members: Kevin Eggert, Josh Jenkins, Mike Shoemake, Stephanie Zhao

Project Description: Our project will look at the relationship between precipitation and wildfires in California.

Research Questions (3-4): Where does it rain most frequently in California and is there a correlation with wildfires? Is there a correlation between total amount of rain in a specific area and the total number of wildfires? Is there a correlation between total number of acres burned and precipitation or the size of wildfires? Is there a correlation between the duration of a wildfire and precipitation? Do fires last longer when there is less precipitation? Could there be outside factors shortening the duration of a wildfire?
