Question 2: Is there a correlation between rainfall and the total number of wildfires?
  Based on the statistical analysis conducted we can conclude that there is no clear relationship between the amount of rainfall 
  and the number of acres burned using the top 20 California wildfire historical data set. We do not see a normally distributed 
  data set either; p vales are very high (Ares Burned = 3.96 & Rainfall = 1.10). A linear regression model was also trialed, but 
  it was a poor fit (correlation coefficient of -0.15). To conclude, the recommendation would be to capture a larger amount of data 
  to be certain but it looks like no relationship exists.
