Question 3: 

Is there a correlation between the number of structures affected and rainfall due to wildfires? 
Is there a higher number of structures affected due to the lack of rainfall?

Based on the data, there is no correlation between the number of structures affected and rainfall as it pertains to wildfires. With an r-value of -.09,
there is nocorrelation between the number of structures affected and rainfall. One problem with our data is that it is a small data set with only 20 points. 
With more data points, we could morer clearly demonstrate whether or not there is correlation. When taking out the outliers of Zaca and Camp Fire, the r-value 
was .05 which indicated there is no relationship between the number of structures affected and rainfall. 

Besides, our outlier of Camp Fire, it is difficult to find a relationship between how many structures are affected and the amount of rainfall a place receives.
The cause of the wildfire, the spread of the wildfire, the infrastructure and material of buildings and the response to the wildfire may be better indicators 
of how many structures are affected by a wildfire than rainfall. 

Based on our results, we have a p-value of 2.15 meaning our data is not statistically significant and we cannot reject our null hypothesis. If we had more 
data, our p-value may have been closer to .05. Our hypotheses would have been stronger if we had more data to test on.
